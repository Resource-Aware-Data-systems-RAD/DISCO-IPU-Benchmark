# Automatic Speech Recognition C++ Sample {#openvino_inference_engine_samples_speech_sample_README}

This sample demonstrates how to execute an Asynchronous Inference of acoustic model based on Kaldi neural networks and speech feature vectors.  

The sample works with Kaldi ARK or Numpy* uncompressed NPZ files, so it does not cover an end-to-end speech recognition scenario (speech to text), requiring additional preprocessing (feature extraction) to get a feature vector from a speech signal, as well as postprocessing (decoding) to produce text from scores.

The following C++ API is used in the application:

## How It Works

At startup, the sample application reads command-line parameters, loads a specified model and input data to the OpenVINO™ Runtime plugin, performs inference on all speech utterances stored in the input file(s), logging each step in a standard output stream.  
If the `-r` option is given, error statistics are provided for each speech utterance as shown above.

For more information, refer to the explicit description of
**Integration Steps** in the [Integrate OpenVINO Runtime with Your Application](../../../docs/OV_Runtime_UG/integrate_with_your_application.md) guide.

### GNA-specific details

#### Quantization

If the GNA device is selected (for example, using the `-d` GNA flag), the GNA OpenVINO™ Runtime plugin quantizes the model and input feature vector sequence to integer representation before performing inference.
Several parameters control neural network quantization. The `-q` flag determines the quantization mode.
Three modes are supported:

- *static* - The first utterance in the input file is scanned for dynamic range. The scale factor (floating point scalar multiplier) required to scale the maximum input value of the first utterance to 16384 (15 bits) is used for all subsequent inputs. The neural network is quantized to accommodate the scaled input dynamic range.
- *dynamic* - The scale factor for each input batch is computed just before inference on that batch. The input and network are (re)quantized on the fly using an efficient procedure.
- *user-defined* - The user may specify a scale factor via the `-sf` flag that will be used for static quantization.

The `-qb` flag provides a hint to the GNA plugin regarding the preferred target weight resolution for all layers. For example, when `-qb 8` is specified, the plugin will use 8-bit weights wherever possible in the
network.

> **NOTE**:
>
> - It is not always possible to use 8-bit weights due to GNA hardware limitations. For example, convolutional layers always use 16-bit weights (GNA hardware version 1 and 2). This limitation will be removed in GNA hardware version 3 and higher.

#### Execution Modes

Several execution modes are supported via the `-d` flag:

- `CPU` - All calculation are performed on CPU device using CPU Plugin.
- `GPU` - All calculation are performed on GPU device using GPU Plugin.
- `MYRIAD` - All calculation are performed on Intel® Neural Compute Stick 2 device using VPU MYRIAD Plugin.
- `GNA_AUTO` - GNA hardware is used if available and the driver is installed. Otherwise, the GNA device is emulated in fast-but-not-bit-exact mode.
- `GNA_HW` - GNA hardware is used if available and the driver is installed. Otherwise, an error will occur.
- `GNA_SW` - Deprecated. The GNA device is emulated in fast-but-not-bit-exact mode.
- `GNA_SW_FP32` - Substitutes parameters and calculations from low precision to floating point (FP32).
- `GNA_SW_EXACT` - GNA device is emulated in bit-exact mode.

#### Loading and Saving Models

The GNA plugin supports loading and saving of the GNA-optimized model (non-IR) via the `-rg` and `-wg` flags.  Thereby, it is possible to avoid the cost of full model quantization at run time. The GNA plugin also supports export of firmware-compatible embedded model images for the Intel® Speech Enabling Developer Kit and Amazon Alexa* Premium Far-Field Voice Development Kit via the `-we` flag (save only).

In addition to performing inference directly from a GNA model file, these combinations of options make it possible to:

- Convert from IR format to GNA format model file (`-m`, `-wg`)
- Convert from IR format to embedded format model file (`-m`, `-we`)
- Convert from GNA format to embedded format model file (`-rg`, `-we`)

### Model Preparation

You can use the following model optimizer command to convert a Kaldi nnet1 or nnet2 neural model to OpenVINO™ toolkit Intermediate Representation format:

```
mo --framework kaldi --input_model wsj_dnn5b.nnet --counts wsj_dnn5b.counts --remove_output_softmax --output_dir <OUTPUT_MODEL_DIR>
```

The following pre-trained models are available:

- wsj_dnn5b_smbr
- rm_lstm4f
- rm_cnn4a_smbr

All of them can be downloaded from [storage](https://storage.openvinotoolkit.org/models_contrib/speech/2021.2).

### Speech Inference

Once the IR is created, you can do inference on Intel® Processors with the GNA co-processor (or emulation library):

```
speech_sample -m wsj_dnn5b.xml -i dev93_10.ark -r dev93_scores_10.ark -d GNA_AUTO -o result.ark
```

Here, the floating point Kaldi-generated reference neural network scores (`dev93_scores_10.ark`) corresponding to the input feature file (`dev93_10.ark`) are assumed to be available for comparison.

> **NOTES**:
>
> - Before running the sample with a trained model, make sure the model is converted to the intermediate representation (IR) format (\*.xml + \*.bin) using the [Model Optimizer tool](../../../docs/MO_DG/Deep_Learning_Model_Optimizer_DevGuide.md).
>
> - The sample supports input and output in numpy file format (.npz)

## Sample Output

The sample application logs each step in a standard output stream.

## Use of Sample in Kaldi* Speech Recognition Pipeline

The Wall Street Journal DNN model used in this example was prepared using the Kaldi s5 recipe and the Kaldi Nnet (nnet1) framework. It is possible to recognize speech by substituting the `speech_sample` for
Kaldi's nnet-forward command. Since the `speech_sample` does not yet use pipes, it is necessary to use temporary files for speaker-transformed feature vectors and scores when running the Kaldi speech recognition pipeline. The following operations assume that feature extraction was already performed according to the `s5` recipe and that the working directory within the Kaldi source tree is `egs/wsj/s5`.

1. Prepare a speaker-transformed feature set given the feature transform specified in `final.feature_transform` and the feature files specified in `feats.scp`:
   ```sh
   nnet-forward --use-gpu=no final.feature_transform "ark,s,cs:copy-feats scp:feats.scp ark:- |" ark:feat.ark
   ```

2. Score the feature set using the `speech_sample`:
   ```sh
   ./speech_sample -d GNA_AUTO -bs 8 -i feat.ark -m wsj_dnn5b.xml -o scores.ark
   ```

   OpenVINO™ toolkit Intermediate Representation `wsj_dnn5b.xml` file was generated in the previous [Model Preparation](#model-preparation) section.

3. Run the Kaldi decoder to produce n-best text hypotheses and select most likely text given the WFST (`HCLG.fst`), vocabulary (`words.txt`), and TID/PID mapping (`final.mdl`):
   ```sh
   latgen-faster-mapped --max-active=7000 --max-mem=50000000 --beam=13.0 --lattice-beam=6.0 --acoustic-scale=0.0833 --allow-partial=true    --word-symbol-table=words.txt final.mdl HCLG.fst ark:scores.ark ark:-| lattice-scale --inv-acoustic-scale=13 ark:- ark:- | lattice-best-path    --word-symbol-table=words.txt ark:- ark,t:-  > out.txt &
   ```

4. Run the word error rate tool to check accuracy given the vocabulary (`words.txt`) and reference transcript (`test_filt.txt`):
   ```sh
   cat out.txt | utils/int2sym.pl -f 2- words.txt | sed s:\<UNK\>::g | compute-wer --text --mode=present ark:test_filt.txt ark,p:-
   ```
